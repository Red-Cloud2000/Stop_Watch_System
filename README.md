# Stop_Watch_System

A design for a stop watch using ATmega16/32 M.C.(with AVR M.P.) consisting of six 7-segments; two for seconds, another two for minutes and the last for hours. The 7-segments are always displaying their read without any off times unless we stopped the clock. Here we have 3 buttons; one for Reset the stop watch, one to stop it without powering off and the last one to resume. 


## To run this project: ##
1- Download an IDE that have an AVR package (I recommend eclipse for you)<br />
2- Download the AVR package and install it on eclipse (ask google if stuck first and if still don't hisitate to contact me)<br />
3- Create these 4 .c & .h files with same names<br />
4- Copy the code in each own file<br />
**note: ofcourse if you have an eclipse IDE working with an AVR package you only have to download the project, un zip it and open it on eclipse**<br />
5- Build it<br />
6- Go to Protues file and open it<br />
7- Double click on the micro controller and choose the program file (.elf) from the debug folder in the project folder<br />
8- Click run<br />
9- Enjoy your timer and please if you recognize any weird action in the simulation please notify me<br />
