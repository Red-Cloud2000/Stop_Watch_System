# Stop_Watch_System

A design for a stop watch using ATmega16/32 M.C.(with AVR M.P.) consisting of six 7-segments; two for seconds, another two for minutes and the last for hours. The 7-segments are always displaying their read without any off times unless we stopped the clock. Here we have 3 buttons; one for Reset the stop watch, one to stop it without powering off and the last one to resume.
